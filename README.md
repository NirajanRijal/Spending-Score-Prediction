# Spending-Score-Prediction

Let's summarize the key points:

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Lower is better. Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Lower is better. Provides the same interpretation as MSE but in the same unit as the target variable (Spending_Score).
R-squared (R²): Higher is better. Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit.


Model Performance:

Linear Regression:

MSE: 555.67
RMSE: 23.57
R²: 0.07 (Low but positive)


Decision Tree Regressor:

MSE: 922.05
RMSE: 30.37
R²: -0.54 (Negative, indicating a poor fit)


Random Forest Regressor:

MSE: 489.01
RMSE: 22.11
R²: 0.18




Interpretation:

The Linear Regression model has the lowest RMSE (23.57) and a positive R-squared value (0.07), indicating that it provides the best fit compared to the other two models.
The Decision Tree Regressor has the highest RMSE (30.37) and a negative R-squared value (-0.54), suggesting a very poor fit.
The Random Forest Regressor has a slightly lower RMSE (22.11) than the Linear Regression model, but a lower R-squared value (0.18).



Therefore, based on the evaluation metrics, the Linear Regression model is the best choice among the three models you tried for predicting the Spending_Score in this dataset. It has the lowest RMSE and a positive (albeit low) R-squared value, indicating a reasonable fit to the data.
However, it's important to note that the R-squared value for the Linear Regression model is relatively low (0.07), suggesting that there may be room for improvement by trying other models or feature engineering techniques. Additionally, we could consider tuning the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor model, as it showed promising performance and might outperform the Linear Regression model with proper tuning.
